  <h2>WEB</h2>
  <p>Web resources may be any type of downloaded media,
  but web pages are hypertext documents formatted in
  Hypertext Markup Language (HTML).[11] Special HTML
  syntax displays embedded hyperlinks with URLs, which
  permits users to navigate to other web resources.
  In addition to text, web pages may contain references
  to images, video, audio, and software components, which
  are either displayed or internally executed in the user's
  web browser to render pages or streams of multimedia
  content.</p>

  Multiple web resources with a common theme and usually
  a common domain name make up a website. Websites are
  stored in computers that are running a web server, which
  is a program that responds to requests made over the
  Internet from web browsers running on a user's computer.
  Website content can be provided by a publisher or interactively
  from user-generated content. Websites are provided for a
  myriad of informative, entertainment, commercial, and
  governmental reasons.
